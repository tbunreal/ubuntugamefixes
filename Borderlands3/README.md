AUTO INSTALLATION



Install playonlinux from initial setup

 

Download playonlinux install scripts for Borderlands 3

 

Extract the files and place the Borderlands3Fix.bash in your HOME folder

 

Run playonlinux and go to tools and run a local script and run install Borderlands 3.pol

 

Once done with the playonlinux script, right click Borderlands3Fix.bash (which should be in your home directory) and run as a program

playonlinux as time of writing has outdated dxvk versions. Download the new ones from my dxvk presository

If you need to install / run an extractor, do that now from this playonlinux virtual drive. You can now create a shortcut in playonlinux to your borderlands3.exe and run!

**BUGS:** I have encountered an unfortunate glitch on my system. If Borderlands does not startup once closed, you will need to edit GameUserSettings.ini which may be found in "/home/YOUR USERNAME HERE/Documents/My Games/Borderlands 3/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor"
