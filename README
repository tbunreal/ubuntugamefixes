AUTO INSTALLATION



Install playonlinux from initial setup



Download GTA5 playonlinux install script 



Create a shortcut from playonlinux to your PlayGTAV.exe


BUGS: I have encountered an unfortunate glitch on my system. When using keyboard and mouse, 
the game lags considerably. With an xbox one controller, there is no lag. Also, there may be 
some minor issues with certain shadows and reflections.
